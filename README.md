# Expo Camera: Android Permission Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo Camera API on Android: permission-related errors. The problem often arises from inconsistencies in the app's manifest file or incorrect runtime permission handling.

## Problem

The core issue involves the camera failing to initialize on Android devices due to permission problems.  The error messages from Expo are sometimes unclear, making it hard to pinpoint the root cause.  This could result from missing permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml or errors in how permissions are requested during runtime.

## Solution

The solution involves double-checking and ensuring the correct permissions are declared in the `app.json` (for Expo managed workflow) or the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (for Expo bare workflow)  and using the `Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()` function correctly during runtime to handle user permission granting.
