This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API and involves issues with permissions, especially on Android.  The manifest may not correctly declare the necessary permissions, leading to a runtime error even if you believe you've requested them.  Additionally, there might be conflicts with other libraries or incorrect usage of the `Camera` component itself.  The error message might be vague, sometimes referring to a missing permission or a general failure to access the camera.
